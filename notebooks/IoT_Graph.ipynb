    "The goal of this setup is to attempt to recognize how air and thermal energy flow throughout an indoor space. This indoor space is a 3rd floor apartment in Boston, MA consisting of two rooms, a bedroom and a workshop. Both rooms have a window, the one in the workshop faces East, and the one in the Bedroom faces South. \n",

    "The hope is that we will be able to predict the readings of these sensors given a weather forecast for any given day. Additionally, we will be exploring the relationship between the sensors and attempt to identify activities that are happening in the rooms based on the sensor readings. Finally, the real world isn't perfect, so we have some gaps in our data and it would be nice to be able to identify and fill in those values with predictions.\n",

As part of the Schema, Edges are computed during data load and sotred in memory rather than being computed during query time.\n",

    "### The Story Behind `Day` and `Hour`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Day` and `Hour` might not make sense at first as Vertex Types. Why not just store the full datetime attached to each `Reading`?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason comes down to our data. Each of the indoor sensors captures a new batch of readings about every 2 minutes. The Outdoor data is fetched from a weather API and has 15 minute to 1 hour intervals seemingly at random. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we're looking to correlate our Outdoor readings with our Indoor readings then we can't compare them 1:1 due to the difference in frequency (max 1 hour vs 2 minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two options are:\n",
    "- Interpolate the Outdoor readings to the same frequency as the Indoor readings\n",
    "  - Pros: High frequency data from both sources\n",
    "  - Cons: Assumed values of interpolated readings can yield inaccurate results\n",
    "- Round Indoor (and Outdoor) readings to the same low frequency that contains at least one reading per sensor, per period\n",
    "  - Pros: More accurate as readings aren't assumed\n",
    "  - Cons: Low frequency of data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demo, I chose the second option, Round to a common value. This is why `Hour` exists. When comparing readings from Outdoor and Indoor, the query can simply SELECT any `Reading` vertices that are connected input `Day`, `Hour`, and `Device` vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hour` and `Day` essentially act as an easily accessable way for us to query a specific time period without having to check the date of every `Reading` in the Graph. **VertexID** exists entirely in **RAM** and **Edges** act as **Pointers** between memory addresses. **Attributes** are stored on **Disk**, so accessing them incurs a performance penalty. **Without** `Hour` and `Day`, selecting all `Readings` from an hour long time period on a specific day would involve selecting every `Reading` in the graph and checking it's captured_at attribute on disk to see if it is within the time range. **With** `Hour` and `Day`, we use the **VertexID** (in RAM) of the input `Day` and `Hour` to traverse Edges (also in RAM) to any `Reading` vertices connected to both the input `Hour` and `Day`. With this method, the entire query operates on data stored in RAM and only touches the verties that are actually returned from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the scale of the data in this demo, the performance impact of these methods is negligable (<3ms), but real-world scale with hundreds of millions+ readings will benefit from foresight when building the schema."
