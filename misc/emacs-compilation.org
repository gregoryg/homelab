* Configure and compile
  NOTE: Emacs must be compiled with modules support in order to use Jupyter

     As of Emacs 30.1, native JSON support is always available; the --with-json config option has been dropped.

#+begin_src bash
  cd emacs-source
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-imagemagick --with-mailutils --with-native-compilation --with-modules --with-tree-sitter
  # --with-json
  # --with-xwidgets - on 2024-10-07 could not get xwidgets to compile - Emacs 30.1-ish
  time make bootstrap -j
  sudo make install
#+end_src
