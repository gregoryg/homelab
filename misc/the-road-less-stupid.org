* Notes from The Road Less Stupid by Keith J. Cunningham
* Thinking time
** great question as the launching pad - create and write a question(s) to think about
** clear calendar for 60 minutes, set timer for 45
** 3 possible scenarios for Thinking Time questions
   1. Create a new question
   2. Revisit a prior question for additional thought
   3. Use and answer from a prior session as the basis for refining the original question
** Be prepared to split current question to next Thinking Time session
   + 45 minutes may be insufficient
** Close door, turn off phones, eliminate noise and visual distractions
** Set a timer
** sip water, scratch, go to bathroom, clear throat, then sit perfectly still
** focus/concentrate
** Empty dot in journal
   + e.g. How would I run my business if 100% of future customers were referral only?
     + ABC
     + XYZ
     + .....
** no filtering or judgment
   + what else could it be
   + what could I do that would make this problem worse
   + how would my competition solve this problems
** Let one idea spark another tangential idea ... follow that train of thought
** Use the third third
** Take 15-20 monutes to read what I have written and capture best ideas
   + usually no more than 3
** Capture ideas while fresh
   + Key is to connect the dots, not just collect more dots
** 2-3 Thinking Time sessions in a week
* Bumper stickers
  + Consultants have a recipe.  Masters have a cookbook!
* Thinking Time examples
** TODO From Chapter 5
   + Where are we compromising by looking for the door marked "WOW"?
   + What shortcuts are we attempting to take that are not really shortcuts but rather
     mirages of greed, laziness or impatience?
   + What skills do I need to master to attain the success I want?
   + Realistically, how much additional time and practice re required for me to attain
     my outcomes?
   + Who can I hire as a coach or mentor to help guide me and hold me accountable?
   + Where do I need to practice to improve my game and thus deserve the success I want?
   + Where do we need to pick up the level of intensity in how we are playing this game?
